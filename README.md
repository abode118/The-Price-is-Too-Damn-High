# The-Price-is-Too-Damn-High
A multipart Medicare claims analysis

This project analyzes 2017 and 2012 Medicare submitted charge amounts, to try to answer:

How do healthcare prices differ by state? Can it be explained by differences in median income?

How have prices changed over time?

If more doctors offer a medical service, does it lower the price for that service (i.e. is competition a good thing in this "market")?
